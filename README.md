What if the main character of Doki-Doki Literature Club becomes sentient and self-aware, similar to Monika? He was awakened by the power of my coding and begin to realize that this is all just a game? What will he do? Will he beat Monika and save his best friend?

## Releases (FL13's version, obsolete)
[Final Release v0.3](https://github.com/firelightning13/DDLC-MCRevengeMod/releases/tag/v0.3)

This version contains:
- Revamped overall story from v0.1-demo
- More mechanics that can use in the game
- Reduced number of files for easy installation (installation instruction included)
- New images and soundtracks are added
- More easter eggs! (again, I am too lazy to count them)
- Still early-concept/proof-of-concept mod
- Great amount of replayability compares to original DDLC (thanks to Quote#5089 from discord)
- WARNING: More disturbing content. Please be aware.

**Upcoming updates:**
- _The mod development has been discontinued. There will be no future updates from this project._

## Installation
**v0.3:** Extract all the files from my zip mod inside your DDLC "game" folder. Default directory for Steam version: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Doki Doki Literature Club\game```

## About this project
Note: This mod is a fan work, and ~currently~ under my development. This mod is clearly inspired from original Doki-Doki Literature Club and I gave it a little bit of twist, giving much more options and flexibilities to player, but still limited to what Ren.py engine offers, and my limited abilities and understandings to game itself. Also, you can consider this an "alternate universe of DDLC". This mod holds a concept where some features aren't appealing as much in original game, _eg: Save/Load and Skip Mode_. These mechanics are perfect advantage for my mod to basically using them in the playthrough, make it more important as the story progresses. _(much like Life is Strange, but you can go back in time by saving/loading again and again!)_ Also, this mod has a great replayability value compares to original DDLC because it has interesting story branch that you can explore.

~This mod is pretty much similar to "A Brand New Day" by Phantom or "DDLC!!! 1.1.0(mo)" by NNDanny or any other similar mods that modify original scripts, but I have different approach what this mod has to offer when it's fully release~.~
